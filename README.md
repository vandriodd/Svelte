## Introduction

Welcome to the Svelte repository dedicated to tracking and sharing progress on the Svelte Full Course offered by Fireship. This repository has been created for educational purposes and aims to provide a source of reference and learning for the Svelte framework.

As an student, I have embarked on this project to explore Svelte's capabilities and share my progress as I advance through the course. This platform will be useful for those looking to follow the same course or anyone interested in learning more about Svelte :)

## About

This repository is educational and personal in nature. Its primary purpose is to allow me to learn and deeply understand the Svelte framework while offering other people an opportunity to explore this learning process together!

## Contents

Within this repository, you will find:

- **Source Code:** All code examples developed following the course lessons.
- **Personal Documentation:** My personal notes and comments that I have compiled during my progress in the course. These notes may be helpful for reviewing key concepts and solving common problems.
- **Additional Resources:** Links to external resources that I have found useful while exploring the Svelte framework.
