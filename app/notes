The app/ directory contains all files/resources/whatever is needed for a SvelteKit project.
It actually looks like this:

app/
├ src/
│ ├ lib/
│ | └ Contains utilities and components (can be imported by $lib alias)
| ├ routes/
| | └ Contains the routes of the application
├ static/
│ └ Contains static files/assets (images, fonts, etc)
├ package.json
├ svelte.config.js
├ tsconfig.json
└ vite.config.js

Package.json
It is a configuration file that contains the project description (name, version, dependencies and scripts)

Svelte.config.js
This file contains all the configuration for SvelteKit. It is used to configure the adapter, preprocessors, etc.

Tsconfig.json
This file configures TypeScript for the project. It is used to configure the compiler options, paths, etc.

Vite.config.js
It turns out that a SvelteKit project is actually a Vite project that uses the @sveltejs/kit/vite plugin. Crazy, indeed.

What is Vite?
Well, it's a 'build tool' used to build the general structure of the project, including the code base of each file. It 'initializes' the application, so to speak.
